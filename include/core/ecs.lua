  == Entity Component System ==
    The ECS functions in much the same way as you expect.
    There are components defined in their respective component modules
    and entities are defined in lua files in the entity folder.
    Making a new entity is as simple as defining what components that entity
    will acquire.
    The heart of the ECS is the update callback. Once called, it steps through
    every active entity, updating all its components.
    Every component has an _update_ function and every entity calls their owned
    component's update as a method. This affords great flexibility because
    any entity can have any component or combination of components.
    But it also implies that each component is not aware of eachother.
    Mostly this is a good thing, but it can be hard to get things to work the
    way you want them to when you're not used to it.

-- If an entity requests destruction, it is flagged as non-existant, so you don't
-- have to worry about it continuing to do things after you destroy it,
-- even if the components are still cleaning up.
